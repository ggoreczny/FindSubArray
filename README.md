# Find Array 

Implement the `MyFindArray.FindArray(int[] array, int[] subArray)` method that given two arrays as parameters will find the starting index where the second parameter occurs as a sub-array in the array given as the first parameter.

If given sub-array (second parameter) occurs more than once then the method should return the starting index of **the last occurrence**.

Your implementations should return `-1` if the sub-array cannot be found.

For extra points: implement it in an efficient way for large input arrays.

Sample Input:
```
[4,9,3,7,8] and [3,7] should return 2.
[1,3,5] and [1] should return 0.
[7,8,9] and [8,9,10] should return -1.
[4,9,3,7,8,3,7,1] and [3,7] should return 5.
```

Please mind that you can add tests to the `MyFindArrayTests` class if you want to self-assess your solution.
